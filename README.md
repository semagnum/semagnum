Hello, welcome to my page!

## Blender

Within Blender, I create art as well as develop tools, some of which I [sell online](https://blendermarket.com/products/nview-v3?ref=2870). You can find my art at [portfolio.pixelfed.social/smagnusson](https://portfolio.pixelfed.social/smagnusson), but my free tools live here, including:

- **[Light Painter](/light-painter/)** - "turns light design in Blender on its head: instead of manipulating the lights, you indicate how you want them to appear on your models by painting their influence. Very cool and innovative!" - Blender Nation
- **[Scene Complexity](https://github.com/semagnum/blender-scene-complexity)** - convenience add-on that retrieves scene statistics to better understand geometry and node tree complexity.
- **[BLint](/blint/)** - automate standardization and file conventions on the Blender projects.
