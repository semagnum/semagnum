Hello, welcome to my page!

## Blender

Within Blender, I create art as well as develop tools, some of which I [sell online](https://blendermarket.com/products/nview-v3). You can find my art at [spencermagnusson.artstation.com](https://spencermagnusson.artstation.com), but my free tools live here, including:

- **[Light Painter](/light-painter/)** - "turns light design in Blender on its head: instead of manipulating the lights, you indicate how you want them to appear on your models by painting their influence. Very cool and innovative!" - Blender Nation
- **[Cy-culls](https://github.com/semagnum/cy-culls)** - convenience add-on that organizes Cycles's culling options all in one place, including operators to enable and disable all objects for culling easily.
- **[BLint](/blint/)** - automate standardization and file conventions on the Blender projects.
